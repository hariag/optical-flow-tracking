# Python, C++ and C# optical flow tracking

g++ -std=c++11 optical_flow.cpp -o optflow `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

Using Optical Flow for Detection Motion object.



Original code from the forked repo and  https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/2.4.12/samples/python2/opt_flow.py   
1. using video path : python optical_flow.py [video source]  
2. using camera : python optical_flow.py   

Few little changing to the original python script to make it run with opencv 3.2.0 and ported also to C++  and C#

A C++ example using the optical flow algorithm described by Gunnar Farneback can be found at https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/fback.cpp

the C++ flow -> hsv -> bgr function:
